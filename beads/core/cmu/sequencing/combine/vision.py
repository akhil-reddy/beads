The combine operation of the Push Implementation (refer Turing Beads.good-notes)

In this operation, the RGB image is converted into a lightweight "beehive" like structure. This structure
is analogous to a set of coloured rain drops separated by a membrane.

After conversion, each unit / "drop" is combined with its neighbours based on similarity. The membrane
is dissolved, and they form a larger "drop".
